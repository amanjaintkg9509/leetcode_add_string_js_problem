# leetcode_add_string_js_problem

Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

Constraints:

* 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104

* num1 and num2 don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without using any built-in BigInteger library or converting the inputs to integer directly?
